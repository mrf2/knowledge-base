# Tools
## Aircrack-ng
**Aircrack-ng** is a suit of tools for **auditing wireless networks**
 - **Aircrack-ng** can **capture packets, crack WEP/WPA keys,** and **analyze Wi-Fi traffic**
 - It is especially effective for **penetration testing** of **802.11** networks
## Burp Suite
**Burp Suite** - A proxy tool mainly used for **web app security testing** (XSS, SQLi, etc.). **Burp suite** is a powerful toolset used primarily for **web application security testing**. Its **intercepting proxy** allows penetration testers to:
 - View and **modify HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses** in real time.
 - Performing **manual testing** for vulnerabilities like **XSS, SQLi,** and **CSRF.**
 - Use built-in tools like **Repeater, Intruder**, and **Scanner** for deeper analysis.

## Cain & Abel
**Cain & Abel** is Password recovery tools for Windows. It is also used for sniffing and cracking hashes.

## Hydra
**Hydra** is a **brute-force password cracking** tool for services like SSH, FTP, HTTP, etc.

## John the Ripper
**John the Ripper** is a Password **cracking tool**.
**Jhon the Ripper:** A well-known password-craking tool, commonly used in penetration testing to identify weak or easily guessable passwords. It can work with password hashes and try dictionary, brute-force, or hybrid attacks.

## Kismet
**Kismet** is a **wireless network detection and sniffer tool**. It's used to audit wireless networks by:
 - Detecting SSIDs (even hidden ones)
 - Sniffing wireless packets
 - Identifying network types (802.11a/b/g/n/ac)
 - Monitoring signal strength and encryption
 - Logging wireless activity
It operates **passively**, so it doesn't send packets - making it great for stealthy wireless reconnaissance.
