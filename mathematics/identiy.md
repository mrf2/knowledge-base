# Examples of `identity` in different contexts

|Context|Operation|Identity Element|Law|Meaning|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Addition**|$+$|**0**|$a+0=a$|Zero is additive identity|
|**Multiplication**|$\times$|**1**|$a \times 1 = a$|One is multiplicative identity|
|**Logic (AND)**|$\land$|`true` or `1` | $A \land 1 = A$|`true` doesn't change the value of A under *AND*|
|**Logic (OR)**|$\lor$|`false` or  `0`|$A \lor 0 = A$|`false` doesn't change the value of A under *OR*|
|**Sets (Union)**|$\cup$|$\emptyset$|$A \cup \emptyset = A$| Union with empty set doesn't add anything|
|**Sets (Intersection)**|$\cap$|***U*** (unisersal set)|$A \cap U = A$| Intersection with whole universe doesn't exclude anything|

 - ***0*** is the identity for addition, but **not** for multiplication.
 - ***1*** is the identity for mulitiplication, but **not** for addition.
 - $\emptyset$ is the identity for union, but **not** for intersection.
 - ***U*** is the identity for intersection, but **not** for union
