# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Classification
 * **Spoofing:** An attacker pretends that he is someone else, perhaps in order to inflict some damage on the person or organization impersonated.
 * **Tampering:** An attacker is able to modify data or program behavior.
 * **Repudiation:** An attacker, who has previously taken some action, is able to deny that he took it.
 * **Information Disclosure:** An attacker is able to obtain access to information that he is not allowed to have.
 * **Denial of Service:** An attacker prevents the system attacked from providing services to its legitimate users. The victim may become bogged down in fake workload, or even shutdown completely.
 * **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker, who has entered the system at a low privilege level *(such as a user)*, acquires higher privileges *(such as those of an administrator)*.

### zero-day
**zero-day** is a vulnerability that is discovered by attackers *before* the vendor or developer becomes aware and can issue a fix. It poses high risk because there is no defense available until a patch is released.
