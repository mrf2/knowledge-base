### Electric Current
*Electric Current* is the total charge that passes through some cross-sectional area A per unit time.
If $\Delta Q$ is the amount of charge passing through an area in a time interval $\Delta t$, then the *average current* $I_{ave}$ is defined as: 

$I_{ave} = \frac { \Delta Q}{ \Delta t}$

If the current changes with time, we define the *instanteneous current I* by taking the limit as $ \Delta t \rightarrow 0$, so the that the current is the instanteneous rate at which charge passes through an area:


I = $\lim \limits_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac {\Delta Q}{ \Delta t} = \frac {dQ}{dt}$
