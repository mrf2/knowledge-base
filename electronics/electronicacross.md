# Across in Electronics
### Two-Terminal Devices
Most basic electronic components have **two terminals**. The world "across" always referes to the **voltage (or potential difference)** between those two terminals.
|Component|What does "across" mean?|
|---|---|
|Resistor ***R***| $V = V_{left} - V_{right}$|
|Capacitor ***C***| Voltage difference between its plates|
|LED or Diode|Forward/reverse voltage between terminals|
|Battery|Voltage betwees its + and - terminals|

### "Across" vs "Through"
|Concept|Voltage (Across)|Current (Through)|
|---|---|---|
|Unit|Volts (V)|Amperes (A)|
|Nature|Difference between two points|Flow through a path|
|Multimeter probes|One on each end|Break the circuit to insert meter in series|
|Language|"across the resistor"|"throgh the resistor"|
|What chagne it?|Resistance, capacitance, etc.|Circuit connections, resistive paths|
