# LED
## LED resistor Equation
$R = \frac {Voltage_{Power Source} - Voltage_{LED Forward Voltage}} {Current_{LED required current}}$

## Typical LED Forward Voltages (+/- 0.2v variance)
|LED Type|Forward Voltage|
|---|---|
|Red|2.0v|
|Yellow|2.1v|
|Green|2.2v|
|Blue|3.5v|
|White|3.2v|

***Recommended maximum current for these LED is I = 20mA***
