# Logic and Set Theory

### What is a `proposition`?
**Answer**: In logic, a proposition is a sentence that is either ***true*** or ***false*** - not **both**.
***Examples:***
 - 5 is a odd number. $rightarrow$ **Proposition (*true*)**
 - Open the book. $rightarrow$ **Not a Proposition (*it's a command*)**
 - `x > 2` $\rightarrow$ **Not a Proposition *until we give x a value***.

### What is `Logical Equivalence`?
**Answer**: Two logical expressions are ***logically equivalent*** if they always have the ***same truth table***, no matter what truth values the variable take.
***Example:***
```bash
A ∨ B ≡ B ∨ A
```
This means: `A OR B` is logically equivalent to `B OR A`.
