# Mile vs Kilometer

## Mile (Imperial/US Customary):
 - **Origin:** From the Romasn "mille passus" meaning a thousand (1 pace = 2 steps).
 - **Used Since:** Roman times (~1st century CE).
 - **Length Standardized AS:** 
    - **Old English mile:** varied widely
    - **1593 (Englan):** Officially defined as 5,280 feet by Queen Elizabeth I.
 - **1 mile = 1,609.344 meters*
 -> *so we simple assume that about 2000 steps is one mile*

## Kilometer (Metric System):

 - **Origin:** French Revolution era (~1790s).
 - **Adopted:** France introduced the metric system in 1799, including the **kilometer**.
 - **Length Defined As:** **1 kilometer = 1,000 meters** (kilo = 1,000, from Greek)

## So:
 - The **mile** is over **1,500 years older**.
 - The **kilometer** came from an **atempt to rationalize and standardize** all units around 10s, 100s, 1000s.

## The Kilometer Easier to Visualize
In **metric system**, everything is built on powers of 10:
 - 1 km = 1,000 meters
 - 1 m = 100 centimeters
 - 1 cm = 10 millimeters

So we can mentally scale **distances, maps**, or **speeds** very easily.
Maybe this is the reason why **scientific, military, and international applications** almost universally prefer metric.
