# Metasploit

 * To access metasploit framework run the `msfconsole` command in terminal to get the **Metasploit console**. The console will be the main interface to interact with different modules of the Metasploit Framework. **Modules** are small components within the Metasploit framework that are built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, or performing a brute-force attack.

## Exploitation process
The exploitation process comprises three main steps:
 1. Finding the exploit
 2. Customizing the exploit, and
 3. Exploiting the vulnerable service

## Module type and Categories
|Module Type|Purpose|Categories|
|---|---|---|
|Auxiliary|Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers can be found here.|`admin, analyze, bnat, client, cloud, crawler, docx, doc, example.py, example.rb, fileformat, fuzzers, gather, parser, pdf, scanner, server, sniffer, spoof, sqli, voip, vsploit`|
|Encoders|Encoders will allow us to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solutions may miss them. *Signature-based antivirus and security solutions have a database of known threats. They detect threats by comparing suspicious files to the database and raise an alert if there is a match. Thus encoders can have a limited success rate as antivirus solutions can perform additional checks.*|`cmd, generic, mipsbe, mipsle, php, ppc, ruby, sparc, x64, x86`|
|Evision|While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software. On the other hand, **"evasion"** modules will try that, with more or less success.|`applocker_evasion_install_util.rb, applocker_evasion_msbuild.rb, applocker_evasion_presentationhost.rb, applocker_evasion_regasm_regsvcs.rb, applocker_evasion_workflow_compiler.rb, process_herpaderping.rb, syscall_inject.rb, windows_defender_exe.rb, windows_defender_js_hta.rb`|
|Exploits|Exploits, neatly organized by target system.|`aix, android, apple_ios, bsd, bsdi, dialup, example_linux_priv_esc.rb, example.py, example.rb, example_webapp.rb, firefox, freebsd, hpux, irix, linux, mainframe, muti, netware, openbsd, osx, qnx, solaris, unix, windows`|
|NOPs|NOPs (No OPeration) do nothing, literally. They are represented in the Intel x86 CPU family with 0x90, following which the CPU will do nothing for once cycle. They are often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes.|`aarch64, armle, cmd, mipsbe, php, ppc, sparc, tty, x64, x86`|
|Payloads|Payloads are codes that will run on the target system. `Exploits will leverage a vulnerability on the target system, but to achieve the desired result, we will need a payload. Examples could be; getting a shell, loading a malware or backdoor to the target system, running a command, or launcing calc.exe as a proof of concept to add to the penetration test report. Starting the calculator on the target system remotely by lanuching the calc.exe application is a benign way to show that we can run commnands on the target system`. Running command on the target system is already an important step but having an interactive connection that allows us to type commands that will be executed on the target system is better. Such an interactive command line is called a ***shell***. Metasploit offers the ability to send different payloads that can open shells on the target system.|`adapters`: An **adapter** wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example a normal single payload can be wrapped inside a Powershell adapter, which make a single powershell command that will execute the payload. `singles`: **singles** are self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run. `stagers`: **stagers** are responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. ***Staged payloads*** will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once. `stages`: ***stages*** are downloaded by the stager. This will allow us to use larger size payloads.|
|Post|Post modules are useful on the final stage of the penetration testing process, post-exploitation|`aix, android, apple_ios, bsd, firefox, hardware, linux, muti, networking, osx, solaris, windows`|

#### Identify single
Metasploit has a subtle way to help us identify single (also called *inline*) pyaloads and staged payloads.
 * generic/shell_reverse_tcp     `(This is inline (or single) payload, as indicated by the "_" between "shell" and "reverse")`
 * windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp `(This is a staged payload, as indicated by the "/" between "shell" and "reverse")


**Metasploit** is an open-source penetration testing framework that helps security professionals find and exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems. It includes a database of know vulnerabilities and tools and scripts for exploiting them.

### msfconsole common command
|command|purpose|example|
|---|---|---|
|back|leave the current context|`back`|
|background|Once a vulnerability has been successfully exploited, a session will be created. This is the communication channel established between the target system and Metasploit. We can use `background` command to background the session prompt and go back to the `msfconsole` prompt|`background` or `Ctrl+Z`|
|check|This will check if the target system is vulnerable without exploiting it||
|exploit|Launch exploit|`exploit`|
|`exploit -z`|Run without any paramter. The `exploit -z` command will run the exploit and background the session as soon it opens|`exploit -z`|
|gset|Set global parameter||
|help|command usages details|`help set`|
|history|previous command history|`history`|
|info|Detailed information on any module, e.g., author, relevant sources, etc.|`info`|
|ls|listing drectory|`ls`|
|ping|ping request|`ping 8.8.8.8`|
|run|Launch exploit, it an alias created for the `exploit`|`run`|
|search|searching for module or CVE numbers|`search smtp_enum`|
|`search <keyword>`|Searching with keywords such as ***type*** and ***platform***|`search type:auxiliary telnet`|
|sessions|see the existing sessions|`sessions`|
|sessions -i \<session_num\>|interact with existing sessions|`sessions -i 1`|
|show|The `show` command can be used in any context followed by a module type (auxiliary, payload, exploit, etc.) to list available modules|`show payloads`|
|show options|Showing module options e.g., RHOSTS, RPORT, etc.|'show options`|
|unset|Clear set parameter|`unset RHOSTS`|
|unset all|Clear all set parameters|`unset all`|
|unsetg|Clear global parameter||
|use|Select module|`use 0` from search result list|

## Exploits take advantage of vulnerability on the target system and may always show unexpected behavior. A low-ranking exploit may work perfectly, and an excellent ranked exploit may not, or worse, crash the target system.


|module/commands|Purpose|
|---|---|
|*smtp_version*|It will scan a range of IP addresses and determine the version of any mail servers it encounters.|
|*smtp_enum*|scanning host for eusernames, its uses wordlist to do the enumeration. Using the module is a simple matter of feeding it a host or range of hosts to scan and a wordlist containing usernames to enumerate.|

## Exploit Ranking
Every exploit module has been assigned a rank based on its potential impact to the target system. Users can search, categorize, and prioritize exploits based on rankings.

The ranking values are one fo the following, in descending order of reliability:
|Ranking|Description|
|---|---|
|ExcellentRanking|The exploit will never crash the service. This is the case for SQL Injection, CMD execution, RFI (Remote File Inclusion), LIF (Local File Inclusion) etc. No typical memory corruption exploits should be given this ranking unless there are extraordinary circumstances [WMF Escape()](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/windows/browser/ms06_001_wmf_setabortproc.rb)|
|GreatRanking|The exploit has a default target AND either auto-detects the appropriate target or uses an application-specific return address AFTER a version check)|
|GoodRanking|The exploit has a default target and it is the ***common case*** for this type of software (English, Windows 7 for a desktop app, 2012 for server, etc.). Exploit does not auto-detect the target.|
|NormalRanking|The exploit is otherwise reliable, but depends on a specific version that is not the ***common case*** for this type of software and can't (or doesn't) reliably autodetect.|
|AverageRanking|The exploit is generally unreliable or difficult to exploit, but has a ***success rate of 50% or more for common platforms***.|
|LowRanking|The exploit is nearly impossible to exploit, has a ***under 50% success rate for common platforms***.|
|ManualRanking|The exploit is unstable or difficult to exploit and is basically a DoS, has ***15% success rate or lower for common platforms***. This ranking is also used when the module has no use unless specifically configured by the user (e.g.: [exploit/unix/webapp/php_val](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/unix/webapp/php_eval.rb)).|
