# Operational Security (OPSEC)

Operational Security (OPSEC) is a term originally coined in the military to refer to tjhe porcess of protecting sensitive information and operations from adversaries. The goal is to identify and eliminate potential vulnerabilities before the attacker can learn their identity.

 * OPSEC is a process to *identify, control* and *protect* any information related to the planning and execution of our activites.


## Definition provided by NIST:
Systematic and proven process by which potential adversaries can be denied information about capabilities and intentions by indenfiying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified evidence of the planning and execution of sensitive activities. The OPSEC process has five steps:
 1. Identify critical information
 2. Analysis threats
 3. Analyse vulnerabilites
 4. Assess risks
 5. Apply appropriate countermeasures

***OPSEC is not a solution or a set of rules; OPSEC is a five-step process to deny adversaries from gaining access to any critical information***

In the context of cyber security, when malicous actors fail to follow proper OPSEC practices, they might leave digital traces that can be pieced together to reveal their identity. Some common OPSEC mistakes include:
 * Resuing usernames, email addresses, or account handles across multiple platforms. One might assume that anyone trying to cover their tracks would remove such obvious and incriminating information, but sometimes, it's due to vanity or simply forgetfulness.
 * Using identifiable metadata in code, documents, or images, which may reveal personal information like device names, GPS coordinations, or timestamps.
 * Posting publicly on forums or GitHub with details that tie back to their real identity or refveal their location or habits.
 * Failing to use VPN or proxy while conducting malicious activites allows law enforcement to track their real IP address.
