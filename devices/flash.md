 * Flash is divided into regions called ***blocks***, which function much as **sectors** do on **hard drives**.
 * Due to characteristics of the technology used to imeplement **flash**, the blocks are much larger than the typical *512 bytes of hard-drive sectors*.
 * One common flash part for example was 512 kilobytes divided into only eight 64-kilobyte blocks.
 * Flash has the general property that changes from ***one to zeros*** may be made by simple programming while ***any change from a zero to a one requires rewriting the entire block***. Rewritting the entire block can also take many hundreds of milliseconds.
