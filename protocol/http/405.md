# 404 - Method Not Allowed

## `405 Method Not Allowed` triggers when:
 1. ✅ The **path is valid**
   `/some/path` is real, registered endpoint.
 2. ❌ The **HTTP method is not mapped**
   * We used `POST`, but the server only allows `GET`
   * We used `GET`, but the server only allows `POST`, `PUT`, etc.
 3. 🚫 The request is rejected *before* business logic runs
   * This is a **routing / framework-level** decision.

## Example
|Situation|Response|
|---|---|
|Path exist, wrong method| 405 Method Not Allowed|

## Why `path:/some/path` is included
Frameworks often return structured errors like:
```json
{
    "status": 405,
    "error": "Method Not Allowed",
    "path": "/some/path"
}
```

**This means:**
 * The **request reached the application**
 * The **router matched the path**
 * The **method check failed**

No controller / handler code was executed


## **Typical causes in real systems:**
 * Using `GET` instead of `POST` (very common with auth endpoints)
 * Testing refresh-token endpoints manually
 * Calling a REST endpoint with curl but forgetting `-X POST`
 * Backend intentionally disallows unsafe methods
 * Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)-protected endpoints that allow only specific verbs
