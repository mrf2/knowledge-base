# Regular Language

**Regular langauges are sets of string patterns, regardless of meaning. These patterns are form-based, matchable using finite rules, and don't require nested memory structures**.
 * Regular language is something comprised of some pattern.
 * A **regular language** is defined by **patterns** that can be recognized using **finite memory** *(no stack, no tape - just a finte state matchine). Like: 'aaab', 'cccdab', 'man, 'can', etc.*.
 * These are all examples of **strings**, and a regular language can be defined to **accept** certain strings and **reject** others -based solely on patterns like:
   * Fixed sequences *(man)*
   * Repetition *(a\*)*
   * Al
