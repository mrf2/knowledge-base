# Evaluating Information
A few things to consider when evaluating information:
 - **Source**: Identify the author or organization publishing the information. Consider wheather they are reputable and authoritative on the subject matter. Publishing a blog post does not make one an authority on the subject.
 
 - **Evidence and reasoning:** Check whether the claims are backed by credible evidence and logical reasoning. We are seeking hard facts and solid arguments.

 - **Objectivity and bias:** Evaluate whether the information is presented impartially and rationally, recflecting multiple perspectives. We are not interested in authors pushing shady agendas, whether to promote a product or attack a rival.

 - **Cooroboration and consistency:** Validate the presented information by corroboration from multiple independent sources. Check whether multiple reliable and reputable sources agree on the central claims.
