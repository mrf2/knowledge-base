# Honeypot
A **honeypot** is a **decoy system** or **resource** set up to look like a real target for attackers - such as a server, database, or network service - but it's actually fake and isolated. It is used to:
 - **Attract attackers** to interact with it
 - **Log their actions**, tools, techniques, and IPs
 - **Study attack behavior** without risking real assets
 - Sometimes **delay or distract** attackers
Honeypots are **not for storing real data** - that would be risky.
