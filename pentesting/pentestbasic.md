# Pentesting Fundamentals

## Terminology
 * NCSC - National Cyber Security Center
 * ROE - Rules of Engagement. The Rules of Engagement is a document thta gives permission to a penetration tester, defining the targets that the engageemnt applies to and the behaviours/techiques. The ROE is a document that is created at the initial statges of a penetration testing engagement.

Rules of Engagement (ROE) main sections:
|Section|Description|
|---|---|
|Permission|This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organizations for the activity they carried out.|
|Test Scope|This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.|
|Rules|The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that the techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.|

## Methodologies
|Stage|Description|
|---|---|
|Information Gathering|This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organization as possible, for example OSINT and research. *This does not involve scanning any systems.*|
|Enumeration/Scanning|This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.|
|Exploitation|This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.|
|Privilege Escalation|Once successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempted to expand access to a system. Privilege escale horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).|
|Post-exploitation|This stage involves a few sub-statges:|
||1. What other host can be targeted (pivoting)|
||2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user|
||3. Covering performed tracks|
||4. Reporting|

## Black Box, White Box, and Grey Box Penetration Testing
### Black-Box Testing
This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.

The tester acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application or piece of software. This testing can involve interacting with the interface, i.e. buttons, and testing to see whether the intended result is returned. No knowledge of programming or understanding of the programme is necessary for this type of testing.

Black-box testing significantly increases the amount of time spent during the information gathering and enumeration phase to understand the attack surface of the target.

### Grey-Box Testing
This testing process is the most popular for things such as penetration testing. It is a combination of both black-box and white-box testing processes. The tester will have some **limited** knowledge of the interal components of the application or piece of software. Still, it will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and resolve issues as they find them.

With Grey-Box testing, the limited knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extrembly well-hardened attack surfaces.

### White-Box Testing
This testing process is a low-level process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. The tester will be testing the internal components of the application or piece of software and, for example, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time.

The tester will have **full** knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour and is much more time consuming than black-box testing. The full knowledge in a White-Box testing scenario provides a testing approach that guarantees the entire surface can be validated.
