 - **NetBIOS** is an acronym for Network Basic Input/Output System. It provides services relate to the session layer of the OSI model allowing applications on separate computers to communicate over a local area network. *Windows NETBIOS can be found on port 139.*

 - **UDP** is the acronym for the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol; UDP does not require a connection to be established. UDP is suitable for protocols that rely on fast queries, such as DNS, and for protocols that prioritise real-time communications, such as audio/video conferencing and broadcast.
