# TCP/IP

## Is TCP/IP a Model or a Protocol Suite?
**TCP/IP** is both a Networking Model *and** a **Protocol Suite**.

### 1. TCP/IP as a Model
The **TCP/IP Model** is a **conceptual framework** used to understand how data moves across a network. It has **four layers:**
 * Application
 * Transport
 * Internet
 * Network Access
***We use this model for learning, designing, and troubleshooting network systems***.

### 2. TCP/IP as a Protocol Suite
The **TCP/IP Protocol Suite** is the **collection of actual protocols** that run onthe internet and other networks.

Examples includes:
 * **TCP, UDP** (Tranport)
 * **IP, ICMP, ARP** (Internet)
 * **HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP** (Application)

***This suite defines the rules and standards that ensure reliable communications***.

### Simple Understanding
 * **Model = Concept** (how it works)
 * **Protocl Suite = Implementation** (what actually runs)
