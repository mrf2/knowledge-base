# Firewall
A **firewall** is a security device - hardware, software, or both - that **monitors and filters network traffic** based on predefined security rules. Its main job is to allow or block traffic between networks (e.g., from the interet to internal LAN) to **prevent unauthorized access* while permitting legitimate communication.
