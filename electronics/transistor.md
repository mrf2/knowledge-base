# Transistors

- $V_{BE} = V_{Base} - V_{Emitter} \approx 0.6 \sim 0.7v$
- This must be **maintained,** no matter what absolute voltage the emitter is at.

So:
- If emitter is at **0V,** base needs to be at **~0.6-0.7V**
- If emitter is at **3V,** base bees to be at **~3.6-3.7V**

*This is important in **emitter-followers**, where the emitter isn't tied to ground. If you forget this, your transistor won't turn on as expected.*
