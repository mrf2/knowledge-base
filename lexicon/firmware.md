 * **Definition (classic):** Firmware is software that is ***closely tied to the underlying hardware*** and usually stored in **non-volatile memory** (ROM, Flash, EEPROM, etc.)
 * **Purpose:** Provides the lowest-level control, initialization, and essential runtime services for hardware.
 * **Key characteristics:**
   * Runs **before** or **beanth** an operating system.
   * Usually **not updated frequently** (but can be updated vai ***firmware updates***).
   * Bridges hardware and software by exposing basic services to higher layers.
 * **Examples:**
   * Microcontroller firmware for a washing machine motor driver.
   * BIOS/UEFI firmware for a PC motherboard
   * Router firmware (Linux kernel + vendor drivers + management web UI stored in Flash).

So, **firmware** is about ***the program in non-volatile memory that's essential to make the hardware usable***.
