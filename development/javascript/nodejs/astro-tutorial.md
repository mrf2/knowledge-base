# Astro Tutorial

## Requirements

### Node.js
For Astro to run on our system, we need to have a compatible version of **Node.js** installed. Astro supports **even-numbered** Node.js versions.

To check to see whether we have a compatible version installed, we have to run the following command in our terminal:
```bash
node -v
```

### Astro setup wizard
 1. Install `astro` through node package manager
 ```bash
 # create a new project with npm
 npm create astro@latest
 ```
 2. When the prompt asks us where to create the project, we have to type in the name of the directory like `./newproject`
    * *A new Astro project can only be created in a completely empty folder, so we have to choose name for our folder that does not already exist!*
 3. We will see a short list of starter templates to choose from.
