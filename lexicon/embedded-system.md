# Embedded System

 * **Definition:** An **embedded system** is a **computer system designed for a dedicated function** *(appliance, machine, device)*, usually with constraints *(low power, small memory, real-time operation)*.
 * **Key characteristic:**
   * Hardware + Software *(often firmware)*
   * Usually hidden inside a larger machine/device.
   * Not intended for general-purpose computing
   * May or may not run a full operating system.

 * **Examples:**
   * The control unit inside a microwave oven
   * Engin control unit **(ECU)** in a Car.
   * Feature phones before smartphones
   * A digital wristwatch

**So an embedded system is the "whole package" (hardware + firmware/software + sometimes OS)**.
