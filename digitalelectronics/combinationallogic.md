# Combinational Logic
A circuit whose **output depends only on current inputs** - there is **no memory** of the past.

### Core Characteristics:
 - Stateless
 - No clock
 - Deterministic (same inputs $\rightarrow$ same outputs every time)
 - Used for logic decisions, not data storage

### Examples
|Circuit Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Logic Gates (AND, OR)|Basic building blocks|
|Adders (Half/Full)|Perform binary addition|
|Multiplexers (MUX)|Select one of many inputs|
|Demultiplexers (DEMUX)|Route input to one of many outputs|
|Encoders/Decoders|Translate between formats|
|Comparators|Test equality, grater-than, less-than, etc.|
|ALUs|Arithmetic and Logic operations|
