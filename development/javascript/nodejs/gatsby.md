# gatsby

**Gatsby** is a **modern web framework** for building fast, scalable, and secure websites and web applications. It's often called a **React-based static site generator**. 

## 1. Core Idea
**Gatsby** lets us build websites using **React**, but instead of rendering pages dynamically on a server for every request, it **pre-builds pages as static HTML** at build time. This makes sites extremely fast because the server just serves pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 2. Key Features
 * **React-based**: We write components using React.
 * **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pages are built ahead of time into static files.
 * **Data Integration**: We can pull data from almost anywhere - CMSs like WordPress, Shopify, databases, Markdown files, APIs - using GraphQL
 * **Performance Focused**: Built-in optimization like lazy-loading imaes, code splitting, and prefetching links.
 * **Plugins & Ecosystem**: Gatsby has a huge plugin ecosystem to add features like SEO, analytics, image optimization, etc.
 * **PWA Ready**: Can easily generate Progressive Web Apps.

## 3. When to Use Gatsby
 * Blogs, portfolios, documentation sties
 * E-commerce product catalogs with mostly static content
 * Marketing or company websites that benefit from fast loading and SEO.
 * Sites that can leverage data from multiple sources via APIs
