# Honeypot
A **honeypot** is a **decoy system** or **resource** or service designed to lure attackers, allowing analysts to observe and study attack patterns, tools, and tactics in a controlled environment - without putting real assets at risk. It's common **defensive deception technique** used in cybersecurity research and threat intelligence. It is set up to look like a real target for attackers - such as a server, database, or network service - but it's actually fake and isolated. It is used to:
 - **Attract attackers** to interact with it
 - **Log their actions**, tools, techniques, and IPs
 - **Study attack behavior** without risking real assets
 - Sometimes **delay or distract** attackers
Honeypots are **not for storing real data** - that would be risky.
