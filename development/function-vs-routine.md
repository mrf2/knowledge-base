# Function vs Routine
# function-vs-routine.md
In **Low-level programming**, especially OS kernels, firmware, assembly, and early systems literature, the word **routine** comes up more often that "function".

## 1. General Meaning
 * **Function**
   * A ***function*** is usually defined as a named block of code that takes inputs (parameters), performs computation, and may return a value.
   * $\rightarrow$ Concept comes from **mathematics:** a function maps input(s) $\rightarrow$ output.
 * **Routine**
   * A ***routine*** is a more general term for any sequence of instructions grouped together to accomplish a task.
   * $\rightarrow$ Historically comes from **early programming** (1950s-1970s), where prorammers spoke of "subroutines" or "service routines" instead of "function"
