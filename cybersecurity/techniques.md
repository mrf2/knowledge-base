# Techniques

## Packet fragmentation
 - **Packet Fragmentation** is a technique used by attackers to **bypass Instrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** by **splitting malicious payloads into smaller fragments**.
 - These fragments may seem harmless individually, and some poorly configured IDS might **fail to reassemble them**, allowing the attack to slip through undetected.
