# Docker
**Docker** is a command-line program, a background daemon, and a set of remote services that take a logistical approach to solving common software problems and simplifying our experience ***installing, running, publishing, and removing software***. It accomplishes this using a UNIX technology called containers.

The **Docker** platform has two distinct components:
 * **Docker Engine:** The **Docker Engine**, which is responsible for **Creating and Running containers**.
 * **Docker Hub:** The **Docker Hub**, a cloud service for distributing **Containers**.
