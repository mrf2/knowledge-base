# Pharming
**Pharming** is a type of cyberattack that **redirects users from legitimate websites to malicious ones**, even if the correct URL is entered.

This redirection is usually done by:
 - **Compromising DNS servers** (DNS poisoning)
 - **Altering the victim's local DNS settings** (e.g. editing the `/etc/hosts` file on Linux or `hosts` file on Windows)
The goal is to **harvest login credentials, steal sensitive data**, or install malware - just like phishing, but **more stealthy** because user don't realize they've been redirected.
 - It's **invisible** to the user.
