Developed by Lockheed Martin, **the Cyber Kill Chain** framework is part of the **Intelligence Driven Defence** model for identification and prevention of cyber intrusions activity. The medel identifies what the adversariesw must complement in order to achieve their objective.

The seven steps of the Cyber Kill Chain enhance visibility into an attack and enrich an analyst's understanding of an adversary's tactics, techniques and procedures.

 * A: Advanced: Targeted, Coordinated, Purposeful
 * P: Persistent: Targeted, Coordinated, Purposeful
 * T: Thread : Person(s) with Intent. Opportunity, and Capability
