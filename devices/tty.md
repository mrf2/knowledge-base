# `tty` - Teletypewriter

The name `tty` comes from **Teletypewriter**, literally a machine from the 1960s-70s that allowed users to send text commands to a computer and received printed responses.
 * These were **physical devices**: keyboards + printers connected via serial lines.
 * Early Unix systems were designed around **text-based communication**, so the concept of a terminal (a human interface) was central.
 * Unix abstracted these physical devices into **device files**, which is why `tty` is still everywhere in Linux today.
