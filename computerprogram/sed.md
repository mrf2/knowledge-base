# `sed` - stream editor

`sed` stands for ***stream editor***, a powerful Unix utility used to *parse and transform text*, especially in pipeline. It reads input line-by-line, applies operations (like substitution, deletion, insertion, etc.), and writes the result to standard output.

### Basic Syntax
```bash
sed [options] 'script' [file...]

# If no file is given, "sed" reads from standard input.
```
