# Spoofing - Faking identity (IP, MAC, email, etc.)

## MAC (Media Access Control) Spoofing
A **MAC (Media Access Control)** is a hardware identifier tied to a network interface card. In **MAC spoofing,** an attacker **fakes** their MAC address to:
 - **Bypass MAC filters** on routers
 - Evade Tracking
 - **Impersonate another device** (e.g., to hijack sessions or confuse DHCP)
